        Alappuzha district (Malayalam: [ɐːlɐpːuɻɐ] (listen)), is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala. It was formed as Alleppey district on 17 August 1957, the name of the district being changed to Alappuzha in 1990,[5] and is the smallest district of Kerala.[6] Alleppey town, the district headquarters, was renamed Alappuzha in 2012, even though the anglicised name is still commonly used to describe the town as well as the district.
    
        A town with canals, backwaters, beaches, and lagoons, Alappuzha was described by George Curzon, the British Governor-General of India in the beginning of the 20th century CE, as the "Venice of the Eastern world."[1] The district is best known for its picturesque Kerala Backwaters, by which it is well connected to other parts of Kerala, including the tourist destination of Kumarakom, the district being a well known tourist destination in India. It is also known for its coir factories, as most of Kerala's coir industries are situated in and around the Alappuzha town.
        
        The Vembanad lake, which lies below the sea level, is the longest lake in the Indian peninsula, and the district of Alappuzha lies between this lake and the Arabian Sea.[7] Kuttanad region of the Alappuzha district, which lies below the sea level, is the point of least elevation in the entire India.[7] Kuttanad, also known as The Rice Bowl of Kerala, has the lowest altitude in India, and is also one of the few places in the world where cultivation takes place below the sea level.[8][9]
        
        The district was home to the Communist-led Punnapra-Vayalar uprising against the Divan of the British Princely state of Travancore in the 1940s.[
    
        The present-day town of Alappuzha owes its existence to Raja Kesavadas during the second half of the 18th century CE. However the district of Alappuzha had an important position in the classical Malayalam literature. Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, was well known from the early Sangam period itself.
        History records that the region which now constitutes the modern-day district of Alappuzha had trade relations with the ancient Greece, the ancient Rome, the ancient Levant, the ancient Arabian peninsula, and the Ancient Egypt during the Sangam period in the early centuries of the Common Era.[11]
    
        The ancient port town of Barace which is recorded as an important centre of the Indian Ocean trade in the ancient Greco-Roman travelogues such as the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea (written around 50 CE) is often identified with the modern-day coastal town of Purakkad on the mouth of the Pamba River in the Alappuzha district.[12] This river is also the third-longest river in Kerala only after to the Periyar river and the Bharathappuzha river.[7]
        
        Early members of the Chera dynasty had their home in Kuttanad and were sometimes known as the Kuttuvans.[12] However the regions south of the Pamba River was ruled by the Ay kingdom during the ancient period.[12] Pamba is mentioned as Baris in the ancient Greco-Roman travelogues.[12] There are archaeological evidences of the early period of this district, including ancient fossils, stone inscriptions and monuments, in the archeological sites like the excavation sites, the caves, the temples, etc.[12] The literary works of the Sangam period also help to take a look into the ancient period of the district.[12]

    <h1>Ambalapuzha Sree Krishna Temple</h1>

      <p>
        Ambalappuzha Sree Krishna Swamy Temple is an Indian Hindu temple dedicated to Krishna at Ambalappuzha in Alappuzha district of Kerala. The temple is believed to have been built during 15th century AD by the local ruler Chembakasserry Pooradam Thirunal-Devanarayanan Thampuran. It is one of the seven greatest temples in Travancore.[1]
    
        The idol at Ambalappuzha is likened to Parthasarthi form of Vishnu, holding a whip in his right hand and a conch in his left. During the raids of Tipu Sultan in 1789, the idol of Sri Krishna from the Guruvayoor Temple was brought to the Ambalappuzha Temple for safe keeping for three years.
        
        Payasam, a sweet pudding made of rice and milk is served in the temple and is believed that the Lord Guruvayoorappan visits the temple daily to accept the offering.

    <p>
    Alleppy Coir refers to the Coir products made in Ambalappuzha and Cherthala Taluks of
     Alappuzha district, in the state of Kerala, India. Coir production of this region dates
      back to as early as 1859. The World Trade Organization (WTO) granted Geographical Indication status
     to "Alleppey Coir" in 2007.he production of Coir in Alappuzha dates back to centuries. There are mentions about coir in travelogues of Arabs and in Mythology like Ramayana.[2]
    
     The production of coir in Alappuzha were non mechanized and unorganized until the mid
      19th century. The first coir factory in India at Alleppey Darragh Smail & Company was
       established in 1859 by an Irish American entrepreneur James Darragh. Coir was called 
       Cocoa Mats in American English and Darragh Smail & Co. Ltd.
      had their office and salesrooms at 177, Water Street, New York City.</p>

    <p>Alappuzha, the place where India's Alleppey Lighthouse stands, was one of the busiest ports and trade centres of Kerala. Alappuzha, a part of Travancore, was ruled by Rajas of Erstwhile Travancore before India's independence. After the arrival of the Portuguese, Dutch and English traders, Vizhinjam, Kollam, Travancore and Purakad were the main ports of Erstwhile Travancore through which foreign trade flourished.
    
        The decline of the Port of Purakkad necessitated the rehabilitation of the traders for which Alappuzha was selected as a port and infrastructure was developed. The port was opened to foreign traders in 1792. There was no regular lighthouse provided in the 18th century, only a light on the pier head served the mariners.
        
        As port activities increased, the authorities had to provide for a lighthouse. The construction of the present lighthouse began in the reign of His Highness Marthanda Varma-II Maharaja (ruler of Travancore) and was completed during the reign of His Highness Rama Varma Maharaja of Travancore. The first stone was laid by Mrs Mough Crawford on 26 April 1860.
        
        The 27 m high lighthouse has a teak spiral staircase. A piece of first-order optical equipment with coconut oil double wick lamp light-source supplied by M/s. Chance Bros., Birmingham, was installed and commissioned into service on 28 March 1862. The same equipment continued to serve till 1952 when it was replaced by 500 mm drum optic and DA gas flasher of AGA make.
        
        The current 4th order optic with a 1000 watt electric lamp was installed in 1960. The mains supply was extended to the station in 1960, this enabled the installation of an electrically operated 4th order revolving optic system supplied by M/s BBT, Paris, this replaced the old equipment and was commissioned on 4 August 1960.
